So I finally got serious and decided to sort out my resistor mess. Some time in my first year of studying electronics I purchased an assorted bag of resistors from [Jaycar](http://www.jaycar.com.au/Passive-Components/Resistors/Carbon-Film/1-4-Watt-Carbon-Film-Resistors---300-Pieces/p/RR1680). None of them had any markings on the paper retaining tape stuff, my lack of motivation for sorting them ended up in them being stored in a box and essentially forgotten about.<!--more-->

The process of identifying the resistors was a combination of the little jig I cobbled together with my helping hands and my meter probes. Although my Fluke 12 has an autorange it's not the most accurate meter I've ever used so I kept my colour code chart nearby to check. If you ever want to learn the resistor colour codes sorting a bag of resistors like this is a decent way to burn it into memory.

I chose to sort my resistors into the [E12 series](http://www.resistorguide.com/resistor-values/#E12_series_tolerance_10) as the assorted bag I bought had essentially every value. There were certainly some casualties from the years stored in a box but now I've managed to get most of them in order. After making a mess of the kitchen table and getting my resistors in order I also cleared out space in the cabinet for some of my other components. I allocated some extra little draws for individually bagged ceramic capacitors, diodes, inductors, crystals, transistors and other parts that I have less of.
