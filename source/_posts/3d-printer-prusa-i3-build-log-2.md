So I got my printer calibrated enough to do a first print. I'm a bit ashamed at how long it's taken but I can blame exams for the most part.

The main source I used in order to get set up was [Triffid Hunter's Calibration Guide](http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter%27s_Calibration_Guide), the other source that was quite useful was [Tom's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUPfBJz3I6Y) about calibration of the extruder.<!--more-->

As can be seen from the quality of my first prints I have a fair way to go with calibrating my machine. Now that it's built I'm expecting this 3d printer to be an ongoing development, I've already planned a number of future upgrades, I probably should get it working as well as possible in the current form before upgrading!

For anyone interested here is some of the photos I took while assembling the printer, if you would like a better photo of a particular part or angle in order to help your understanding of the assembly let me know and I'll try and help you out.
