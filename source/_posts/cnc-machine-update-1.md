Unfortunately there hasn't been any progress made on my CNC milling machine since the last post. Lack of funds is the main thing holding me back so I think this project will have to be pushed back to a _"when I can afford to finish it"_ build.

I've been spending a lot more time working on "software only" type projects as they don't cost anything but time. One of these projects has been working on a fork of the Javascript library [bitcoin-address](https://github.com/defunctzombie/bitcoin-address "A library that checks if a bitcoin address is valid") which can validate if a cryptocurrency address is valid. It currently works for approximately 10 different currencies. Source code can be found at github ([altcoin-address](https://github.com/ryanralph/altcoin-address)).
