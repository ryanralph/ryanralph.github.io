Soldered my first SMD component by hand today. Pretty happy to announce that I didn't blow $40 and my RN-52 bluetooth breakout board is now working. One step closer to completing my bluetooth enabled rotary phone build.

A lot of things are happening over the next few weeks (parts are arriving from china) so I can work on my [3d printer build](), OTP generator and a few other bits and bobs so expect to see a few updates!
