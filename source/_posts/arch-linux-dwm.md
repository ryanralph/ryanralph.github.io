# [![Arch Linux](http://blog.ryanralph.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ArchlinuxLogo.png)](http://blog.ryanralph.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ArchlinuxLogo.png)

Having been a primarily Ubuntu user for the past few months I've decided to take the plunge and explore [Arch linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) a bit. For those that are unaware Arch linux is a slimline distro that serves as a solid foundation without any unwanted bloatware. The [Arch way](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way) stresses Simplicity, Code elegance and freedom.<!--more-->

## Why switch?

With the increasing level of surveillance built into software these days it is important to protect yourself by simply choosing which services/products are essential and choosing alternatives for those that are not. In the past few years Ubuntu linux has decided to include advertising as well as ["Ubuntu Spyware"](http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/ubuntu-spyware-what-to-do) which includes tracking different aspects of use. This goes against my ideals for what Linux should be.

Previously loving the Ubuntu classic interface with GNOME 2 the change to Unity was frustrating, even after slowly coming to like the interface I still found it quite unstable. As well as all this Ubuntu has become bloated, it comes installed with a number of software packages that I do not and will not ever use. Sure I could leave it there but if I don't use it or know what it does, what purpose does it serve?

## Installing Arch

With that all said I have started off with just the basics Arch, git, chromium &amp; running DWM (dynamic window manager) with dmenu. To make the install process easier I used some simple arch [install scripts](https://github.com/RommelVR/arch) courtesy of RommelVR.

**Note:** Only use RommelVR's install scripts if you have fully read &amp; understood what they do.

## DWM, ST &amp; Dmenu

Dwm or [dynamic window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/) is a super customisable tiling window manager that is crazy light on resources and is intended to never exceed 2000 SLOC. ST is [suckless terminal](http://st.suckless.org/) and it is just that. [Dmenu](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) is a simple menu to launch programs from within dwm.

## Conclusion

One of the greatest things about Arch/dwm is that it's quick, Super quick! My dev laptop which was bought in 2008 is ready at the login screen in under 5 seconds and is ready almost instantly after I type my password. I'm still relatively new to the arch way but I love the philosophy.
