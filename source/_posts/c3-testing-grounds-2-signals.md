Recently I was involved in a collaboration with artist [Jon Butt](https://www.jonbutt.com/) and my work colleague Alexander Radevski, an industrial designer. The work was displayed at c3 art space in Abbotsford and at [Testing Grounds](http://www.testing-grounds.com.au) creative space in Southbank.<!--more-->

I've linked to Jon's posts about the project which contain more information and photos.

I might update this post another time with some of the technical details, but probably not.
