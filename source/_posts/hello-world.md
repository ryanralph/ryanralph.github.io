My Name's Ryan and I'm currently a 4th year electrical engineering student at RMIT University Melbourne. I've created this blog to showcase and document my current and future electrical and software based projects.<!--more--> I will also share helpful little snippets of code or useful web links and hopefully make this website into not only a resource for myself but other like minded people online.

This blog is also an experiment for myself, I have never kept a blog before so I will try and post on a semi regular basis. I thank you for taking the time to check out my site, Welcome!
