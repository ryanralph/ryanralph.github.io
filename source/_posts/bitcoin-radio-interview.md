From my previous blog post regarding bitcoin I was contacted by ABC 774 Reporter [Prue Bentley](https://twitter.com/Prue_Bentley)Â for an interview about the opinion that Melbourne is bitcoin capital of the world. We had a brief chat on the phone before meeting for an informal discussion about my thoughts about bitcoin.<!--more-->

Among the others interviewed were Asher Tan of [Coinjar](https://www.coinjar.com) and [Dr P.J. Radcliffe](http://www.rmit.edu.au/staff/peter-radcliffe) who happens to be one of my University lecturers and also a bitcoin commentator. I only got a few sentences actually featured on the air but ah well, I guess it's just good to be spreading the word of bitcoin in Melbourne!

The full story can be found [here]( http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2014/02/26/3952804.htm).
