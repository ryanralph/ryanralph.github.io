I have plenty of things on the go at the moment whilst trying to finish my studies as well. This page serves the purpose of keeping me on track to complete more things.

## In progress

## Completed

[DIY Piper](http://blog.ryanralph.net/bitcoin-paper-wallet-update/)

## Future (not started)

[Ambilight clone](http://www.instructables.com/id/30-channel-LED-RGB-Ambilight-Clone/?ALLSTEPS) - probably don't want to go to quite this level of detail.

OTP Generator - similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIJZFUbAyOg) but a little bigger and with a screen to select the account.

Arduino/cloud weather station - Not sure why, just wanted one

Raspberry pi Streaming video/time lapse capture.

Bluetooth "smart watch" - Using just an RGB led, bluetooth module, RTC module and vibration motor.

Arduino/Raspberry pi cheatsheet page. I want to compile a one post collection of how to use many of the common arduino/raspberry pi sensors, switches and IO of all types.

## Postponed

[CNC Machine](http://blog.ryanralph.net/cnc-machine-update-1/) - Delayed due to price and design considerations.

[8x8x8 LED Cube](http://www.instructables.com/id/Led-Cube-8x8x8/?ALLSTEPS) - Need a bit of wood for a jig and a free weekend.
