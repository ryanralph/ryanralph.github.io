My name's Ryan Ralph. I'm a recent graduate from a double degree in Electrical Engineering and Business Management at [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au/).

I've worked with many different programming languages, all for different purposes and some of my favourites at the moment are node.js, python and javascript. I prefer to run either Arch linux or Ubuntu, code in vim and draw PCB's in kiCAD however I'm flexible with all environments.

Outside of work I enjoy playing around with electronics and always have a number of [projects](http://blog.ryanralph.net/projects/) on the go. I'm interested in startups, bitcoin, new tech, old tech as well as physical/digital security.

Although I'm not actively looking I am open to working on interesting and exciting projects so [fire me an email ](http://blog.ryanralph.net/contact/)and we'll chat!
