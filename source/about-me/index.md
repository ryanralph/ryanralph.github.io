My name's Ryan Ralph. I'm a graduate of [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au/) where I studied Electrical Engineering and Business Management. Since completing my degree I have been working with [Aabak](https://aabak.com) on custom robotics projects, notably we designed and built a Robotic barista machine called [Rocky](https://oncealike.com/).

I've worked with many different programming languages, all for different purposes and some of my favourites at the moment are node.js, python and C. I prefer to run either Arch linux or Ubuntu, code in vim and draw PCB's in kiCAD however I'm flexible with all environments.

Outside of work I enjoy playing around with electronics and always have a number of projects on the go. I'm interested in startups, bitcoin, new tech, old tech as well as physical/digital security.

Although I'm not actively looking I am open to working on interesting and exciting projects so [fire me an email ](mailto://blog@ryanralph.net)and we'll chat!
